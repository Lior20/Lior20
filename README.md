🙋 Hey, my name is Lior and I’m a 3rd-year B.Sc. Electrical Engineering student at Tel Aviv University.

As far back as I can remember, technology and innovation have always intrigued me,
Even as a child, I was curious to learn new fields and challenged myself constantly.
As a high school student, I got a glimpse of this field for the first time, and developed a variety of skills, including:

🔹Learning programming languages (C, C++, Python) and experimenting with writing code

🔹Developing Arduino projects at school and privately

🔹Building a robot that operated entirely autonomously as a final project in high school
 (gained Outstanding Project Award)

🔹Participating in FIRST robotics competition.

Following this came the choice to study Electrical Engineering, a degree that allows for broad and in-depth learning in topics that are at the forefront of technology.

🎓 In my studies, I’m focusing mainly on Computer Engineering & Software Development courses, e.g.
Data Structures & Algorithms, ML & Deep Learning, Image Processing, Computer Architecture, Digital Logic Design, VLSI Design.

Currently, after having accumulated sufficient knowledge and many tools during my studies and hands-on projects, I’m eager to use my skills in a place where I can have a greater impact and keep the learning process.

Other then that, When I get the time, I love to:
🌏 - Travel 🏀 - Sports 🎮 - Gaming 📖 - Reading
